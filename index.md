## Overview

AIALGVF is a modular AI system designed to automate various aspects of lettuce farming. This system leverages computer vision, deep learning, and environmental data to detect diseases, classify growth stages, and predict yields. The goal is to enhance productivity and efficiency in vertical farming settings. 

For the latest version of the software, please visit [the Releases section](https://github.com/nq32/AIALGVF/releases). Download the necessary files and execute them to get started.

## Features

- **Disease Detection**: Identify common diseases affecting lettuce plants using image analysis.
- **Growth Stage Classification**: Automatically classify lettuce plants into different growth stages.
- **Yield Prediction**: Use environmental data and machine learning to predict crop yields.
- **Modular Design**: Each component can be used independently or in conjunction with others.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands and visualizations for easy interaction.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Analyze data in real-time for immediate insights.

---

## Technologies Used

AIALGVF integrates various technologies to achieve its goals:

- **Agritech**: Focused on improving agricultural practices.
- **Computer Vision**: Techniques to analyze and interpret visual data.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks to enhance learning from data.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms to make predictions based on historical data.
- **PyTorch**: Framework for building and training deep learning models.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning method for classification tasks.
- **ResNet**: Deep residual networks for image recognition.
- **YOLOv8**: Real-time object detection system.

## Installation

To install AIALGVF, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nq32/AIALGVF.git
   cd AIALGVF
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use pip to install the required packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Models**:
   Visit [the Releases section](https://github.com/nq32/AIALGVF/releases) to download the pre-trained models.

4. **Set Up Environment**:
   Ensure your environment is configured for running deep learning models. 

---

## Usage

To use AIALGVF, you can run the following commands:

1. **Run Disease Detection**:
   ```bash
   python detect_disease.py --image path_to_image
   ```

2. **Classify Growth Stage**:
   ```bash
   python classify_growth.py --image path_to_image
   ```

3. **Predict Yield**:
   ```bash
   python predict_yield.py --data path_to_environmental_data
   ```

Make sure to replace `path_to_image` and `path_to_environmental_data` with your actual file paths.

---

## Model Training

If you wish to train your own models, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is organized correctly. Use labeled images for disease detection and growth stage classification.

2. **Train the Model**:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --dataset path_to_dataset
   ```

3. **Evaluate Performance**: After training, evaluate the model's performance using the validation dataset.

4. **Save the Model**: Save the trained model for future use.
   ```bash
   python save_model.py --model_name model_name
   ```

---

## Results

AIALGVF has shown promising results in various trials:

- **Disease Detection Accuracy**: Over 90% accuracy in identifying common lettuce diseases.
- **Growth Stage Classification**: Accurate classification in 85% of test cases.
- **Yield Prediction**: Predictions align closely with actual yields, with an average error margin of 5%.

Visual representations of these results can be found in the `results` folder.
